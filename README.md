OPTOELECTRONICS ANALOG INFORMATION TRANSMISSION THROUGH LIGHT/AIR


In this project, I have developed a system for transmitting information through a LED.

The role of the circuit: Analog information transmission through a translucent medium (air) is achieved through two circuits consisting of receiver and transmitter configurations, which convert the electrical signal into a luminous one through a LED and convert it back into an electrical signal, taking into consideration the main property of a photoresistor (the resistance is dependent on the incident light intensity).

Functionality: The input of the transmitter is received through the AUX connector of high-performance electronic devices, receiving a low-power analog signal (e.g., music).
➢ This signal is amplified both in voltage and current to transmit the signal to the LED.
➢ The LED adjusts its brightness in correspondence with the input signal amplitude.
➢ Through the luminous signal generated by the transmitter, the resistance value of the receiver's photoresistor changes in accordance with the light signal.
➢ The alternating current signal is filtered from any direct current component through a capacitor.
➢ The corresponding signal is amplified and outputted through audio using a Class D power amplifier and a speaker. I have implemented the circuits in OrCAD, and then physically implemented them on the two boards. You can consult the attached presentation. I have also discussed the transmission medium: AIR.
➢ The LED creates a variation in light in the air, which has a refractive index equal to one, hence the initial signal traverses the transmission medium with minimal optical distortions.
➢ The receiver, using the decoupling capacitor, filters out continuous light sources that interfere with the initial signal, such as daylight, certain flashlights, certain bulbs, etc.

APPLICATIONS
➢ Circuit for demonstrating wireless data transmission (e.g., WiFi).
➢ Educational/demonstrative purposes.
➢ Finding the switching frequency of bulbs.
➢ Visualization of signal wavelength/intensity of the LED.
➢ Visualization of optical distortions (e.g., placing different materials with different refractive indices between the transmitter and receiver).

CONCLUSIONS
➢ The circuit works very well for demonstrative/educational purposes.
➢ The composite circuit aligns with the knowledge gained during the course.
➢ The project highlights the viability and advantages of analog information transmission using light/air as a medium. 

This opens up new horizons in the field of communications and data transfer, leading to increased efficiency and speed in information transmission.
